# CWS.Temp.OstaraDemo
Demo code to pull messages from Azure Service Bus

## Prerequisite
You'll need to setup an environment variable named SHARED_SERVICEBUS_KEY with the value of the Azure Service Bus namespace's shared access key. I'll email it to you separately. Please treat this key as a password. If you want to store it differently and not use an environment variable, that's fine. Please don't commit it to any source code repositories.
